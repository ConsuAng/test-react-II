# spa with shopping cart

This project is the final test of the react II module. For this test I implement a shopping cart for a Pizza shop. Here you can find a spa with Navbar and Footer, and the principals routes are home (/), pizza detail (/pizza/:id) and de shopppig cart resume (/carrito). The home page shows all the available pizza's and you can go to de pizza detail clicking in the blue button, or add that pizza to the shopping cart with the red button. 

The detail page shows the description and ingredients of the selected pizza and also you can add it to the shopping cart by clicking the red button.

The shopping cart shows the resume of your order. Here you increment or decrease the number of each pizza.
